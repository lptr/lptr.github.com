Emboldened by the experiences with [building stuff](../a-new-beginning), I started taking stuff apart around the house, and even fixing some. (Not the grill, though.) I learned that often behind those smooth and unique injection-molded plastic covers there are mostly the same old components. For example, if you disassemble a €30 [Lego servo motor](https://www.lego.com/en-hu/product/power-functions-servo-motor-88004), you will find the same little motor (plus some gears and electronics) as in an €1 IKEA milk frother. A Dyson vacuum cleaner uses the same 18650 power cells (with a bit of clever electronics on top) that you can order yourself! I became more and more curious!
